Description-Content-Type: text/x-rst



**scikit-build** is a Python build system for CPython C/C++/Fortran/Cython
extensions using CMake.

The scikit-build package is fundamentally just glue between the ``setuptools``
Python module and `CMake`_.

The next generation of scikit-build, `scikit-build-core`_, is currently under development.
This provides a simple, reliable build backend for CMake that does not use
setuptools and provides a lot of new features. Scikit-build-core can also power
a setuptools-based extension system, which will eventually become the backend
for scikit-build (classic). If you do not require extensive customization of
the build process, you should consider trying scikit-build-core instead of
scikit-build.

To get started, see `this example <https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#example-of-setup-py-cmakelists-txt-and-pyproject-toml>`_. For more examples, see `scikit-build-sample-projects <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-sample-projects>`_.




Scikit-build 0.17.6
===================

A small fix release with some new platforms and better testing, including CPython 3.12.0b1.

Bug fixes
---------

* Support added for SunOS by `@mtelka <https://github.com/mtelka>`_ in `#983 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/983>`_.
* Support added for AIX (with recent CMake) by `@bhuntsman <https://github.com/bhuntsman>`_ in `#988 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/988>`_.

Testing
-------

* Tests now pass on CPython 3.12.0b1 in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.
* Tests no longer use ``pytest-virtualenv`` in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.
* ``isolated`` marker now includes ``test_distribution`` tests in `#879 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/879>`_.
* Tests avoid incorrect ``get_map`` match by `@keszybz <https://github.com/keszybz>`_ in `#990 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/990>`_.
* Fedora testing fix by `@LecrisUT <https://github.com/LecrisUT>`_ in `#986 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/986>`_ and `#938 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/938>`_.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Docs improvements in `#979 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/979>`_.

Scikit-build 0.17.5
===================

A small fix release fixing the passing on of generator specific arguments. This
fixes some cases where the Ninja generator was found but then was unable to
build. NetBSD was reported to work, so was added to the BSD's supported.

Bug fixes
---------

* Generator args were missing for actual compile in `#975 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/975>`_.
* Add support for netbsd & pyodide (future) in `#977 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/977>`_.



Scikit-build 0.17.4
===================

A followup fix to the issue 0.17.3 tried to fix. We now have a method to
manually test downstream packages, too.

Bug fixes
---------

* Make sure include dir is found even if the lib is not present in `#974 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/974>`_.

Scikit-build 0.17.3
===================

A small release related to ``PYTHON_LIBRARY`` handling changes in 0.17.2;
scikit-build 0.17.3 returns an empty string from ``get_python_library`` if no
Python library is present (like on manylinux), where 0.17.2 returned None, and
previous versions returned a non-existent path. Note that adding ``REQUIRED``
to ``find_package(PythonLibs`` will fail, but it is incorrect (you must not
link to ``libPython.so``) and was really just injecting a non-existent path
before.

Bug fixes
---------

* Keep ``get_python_library``  return type string if python lib non-existing
  for now in `#959 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/959>`_.
* Avoid 'not found' warning if libs are not found by FindPythonExtensions in `#960 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/960>`_.
* FindNumPy should not call FindPythonLibs in `#958 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/958>`_.

Scikit-build 0.17.2
===================

Another small release with fixes for non-MSVC Windows platforms.

Bug fixes
---------

* RPM spec fix by `@LecrisUT <https://github.com/LecrisUT>`_ in `#937 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/937>`_.
* Validate value before returning library path by `@dlech <https://github.com/dlech>`_ in `#942 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/942>`_.
* Only add ``Python_LIBRARY`` on Windows MSVC in `#943 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/943>`_ and `#944 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/944>`_.
* Slightly nicer traceback for failed compiler in `#947 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/947>`_.

Testing
-------
* Hide a few warnings that are expected in `#948 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/948>`_.

Scikit-build 0.17.1
===================

This is a small release fixing a few bugs; the primary one being a change that
was triggering a bug in older FindPython. The unused variable messages have
been deactivated to simplify output, as well.

Bug fixes
---------

* Older (<3.24) CMake breaks when lib specified in `#932 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/932>`_.
* An error output was missing formatting in `#931 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/931>`_.
* Make empty ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` a warning (bug in conda-forge's
  clang activation fixed upstream) in `#934 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/934>`_.
* Remove unused variable warnings by in `#930 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/930>`_.

Testing
-------

* Add Fedora packaging with packit automation by `@LecrisUT <https://github.com/LecrisUT>`_ in `#928 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/928>`_.
* Fix codecov ci by `@LecrisUT <https://github.com/LecrisUT>`_ in `#929 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/929>`_.
* Update some coverage settings in `#933 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/933>`_.



Scikit-build 0.17.0
===================

A lot of bug fixes are present in this release, focusing on Windows, PyPy, and
cross compiling. We've also improved the compatibility with default setuptools
behaviors a little, and enabled some things that were previously unavailable,
like overriding the build type via the cmake argument environment variables.
We've expanded our CI matrix to include Windows and macOS PyPy and some Fortran
tests on Linux. This release requires Python 3.7+.

Bug fixes
---------

* Match setuptools behavior for ``include_package_data`` default. by `@vyasr <https://github.com/vyasr>`_ in `#873 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/873>`_.

* Fix logic for default generator when cross-compiling for ARM on Windows in `#917 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/917>`_ by `@dlech <https://github.com/dlech>`_.
* Use f2py's ``get_include`` if present in `#877 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/877>`_.
* Fix support for cross-compilation exception using ``targetLinkLibrariesWithDynamicLookup`` by `@erykoff <https://github.com/erykoff>`_ in `#901 <https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build/pull/901>`_.

History
-------

PyCMake was created at SciPy 2014 in response to general difficulties building
C++ and Fortran based Python extensions across platforms.  It was renamed to
"scikit-build" in 2016. Scikit-build-core was started in 2022.


Known Issues
------------

These issues are likely to be addressed in upcoming releases, and are
already addressed in `scikit-build-core`_.

* Editable installs do not work with the latest versions of Setuptools (and had
  issues with older versions, too).
* Configuration scikit-build cares about _must_ be specified in ``setup()``
  currently.
* The cache directory (``_skbuild``) may need to be deleted between builds in
  some cases (like rebuilding with a different Python interpreter).
* AIX requires a newer version of CMake than the IBM-supplied CMake 3.22.0
  from the AIX Toolbox for Open Source Software.  We currently recommend
  building CMake from source on AIX.

We are also working on improving scikit-build, so there are some upcoming
changes and deprecations:

* All deprecated setuptools/distutils features are also deprecated in
  scikit-build, like the ``test`` command, ``easy_install``, etc.
* Older versions of CMake (<3.15) are not recommended; a future version will
  remove support for older CMake's (along with providing a better mechanism for
  ensuring a proper CMake is available).

If you need any of these features, please open or find an issue explaining what
and why you need something.
